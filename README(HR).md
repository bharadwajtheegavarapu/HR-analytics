The aim is to build the Classification model is which will predict the classification problem
so prediction based on lot of multiple general factors

Exmining the data imputing missing values, Exploratory data analysis,Dealing with the outliers
Algorithems used:Logistic Regression,Decision tree(classifier),randomforest(classifier)
used hyper-parameters for random forest and K-fold cross validtaion
The quality of classification model is measured by Roc score 
Random forest model givs the high roc score ,its tells us how well the model fits in this data
